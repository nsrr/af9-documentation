# About

Sleep loss leads to profound performance decrements. Yet many individuals believe they adapt to chronic sleep loss or that recovery requires only a single extended sleep episode. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to determine the effects of length of time awake, sleep history (over weeks) and circadian phase on multiple physiological parameters.  Nine healthy volunteers were studied on an inpatient 38-day protocol in which sleep/wake timing, lighting levels, activity levels, and diet were controlled. In the protocol, the usual sleep:wake ratio was reduced from 1:2 to 1:3.3, while the durations of both sleep and wake episodes were increased to ten hours and 32.85 hours respectively. These sleep and wake episodes were distributed across all circadian phases, enabling measurement of the effects of acute and chronic sleep loss at different times of the circadian day and night.
